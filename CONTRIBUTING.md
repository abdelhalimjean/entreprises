## Styling with Tailwind CSS:

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. When making code contributions, please adhere to the Tailwind CSS naming conventions to maintain a consistent and maintainable codebase. Only use custom CSS classes if absolutely necessary, as Tailwind CSS offers a wide range of utility classes for most styling needs.

Benefits of Tailwind CSS for Teams:

- ### Consistency:

  Tailwind CSS promotes consistent design across the project by using pre-defined utility classes. This reduces the risk of style conflicts and makes it easier for new team members to jump in.

- ### Maintainability:

  A smaller codebase with less custom CSS means the project is easier to maintain and update in the long run.

- ### Efficiency:

  Tailwind CSS allows developers to style components quickly by applying utility classes directly in the HTML. This can lead to faster development cycles.

  This a quick cheat sheet for TailwindCSS to ge you started https://tailwindcomponents.com/cheatsheet/

## Code Formatting with Prettier:

This project uses Prettier for automatic code formatting. Prettier is a tool that enforces consistent style across your codebase, improving readability and maintainability.

- ## Enabling Prettier:

  - ### Visual Studio Code:

    Install the "Prettier - Code Formatter" extension from the VS Code marketplace.

    Open the VS Code settings (Code > Preferences > Settings).

    Search for "Prettier" and enable the options "Format On Save"

    Make sure to put the path to prettier ./node_modules/prettier

  - ### IntelliJ IDEA (and other JetBrains IDEs):

    Install the Prettier plugin from the JetBrains plugin marketplace.

    Go to File > Settings > Editor > Code Style > Prettier.

    Enable the options "Run on 'Reformat Code' action" and "On save".
